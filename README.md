# House-Rental-Website
It is a platform that will help landlord and tenants connect together.
before we start working on this project,i want us to install the following extensions in your computer 

the first extension we will install is github pull request and issues
the second extension we will downlaod is github code space
the last extension that we will install is github repositories


we have learnt how to create repos, pull them to your machines and also how to commit changes in vs code. 
the next thing we are going to learn do is start cooding that is learning the front end.

before that, we have talked about the software developement life cycle and the various web technologies that we use in the develpement of complete websites and the process that is required of you to develope a website from start to finish.

we have navigated through internet of things looking at the various servers and web errors and how information is being transmitted in the web so far , we have seen alot of concepts and talked and understood all those concepts if in the process of developement you want to be clear on somethings and know or have doubths in any things you do, dont hesitate to bring it up.

also remember that if there are things that you want to learn or things that you are not sure of your understandings, dont forget to mention it to us so we see how to go about it. 

the reason you came here is to know how to do it so be free as possible, as i say, stop us when we are going to fast and try to catch up
